# Testing
## Testing for COVID-19
[Guidence on interpretion COVID-19 Test Results:](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Testing-Guidance.pdf) A guide for interpreting test results and determining what actions to take.
Two kinds of tests of if you have a current infection
* A viral test tells you if you have a current infection.
* An antibody tests tells you if you had a previous infection.
An antibody test may or may not be able to show if you have a current infection, because it can take 1-3 weeks afer infection to make antibodies. We do not know yet if having antibodies to the virus can protect someone from getting infected with the virus again, or how long that protection might last.
## Who should be tested 
To learn if you have a current infection, viral tests are used. But not everyone needs this test.
* Most people will have mild illness and can recover at home without medical care and may not need to be tested.
* CDC has [guidence](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/clinical-criteria.html) for who should be tested, but decisions about testing are made by [state](https://www.cdc.gov/publichealthgateway/healthdirectories/healthdepartments.html) and [local](https://www.naccho.org/membership/lhd-directory) health departments or healthcare providers.
* If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and want to get tested, call your healthcare provider first.
* You can also visit your state or local health department's website to look for the latest local information on testing.
* Although **supplies of tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find a palce to get tested.**
## Results
* **If you test positive for COVID-19 by a viral test**, know what protective steps to take [if you are sick or caring for someone](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/index.html)
* **If you test negative for COVID-19 by a viral test**, you probably were not infected at the time your sample was collected. However that does not mean you will not get sick. The test result only means that you did not have COVID-19 at the time of testing.
If you test positive ir negative for COVID-19, no matter the type of test, you still should take preventative measure to [protect yourself and others](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html)
