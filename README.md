# Coronavirus Disease 2019
## Symptoms of Coronavirus
## What you need to know
* Anyone can have mild to severe symptoms
* Older adults and people who have severe underlying medical conditions like heart or lung diseases seem to be at higher risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 illness.
## Watch for symptoms
People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported - ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness
Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. People with these symptoms may have COVID-19.
* Cough
* Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing 
* Fever
* Chills
* Muscle Pain
* Sore throat
* New loss of taste or smell

This list is not all posssible symptoms. Other less commom symptoms have been reported , including gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
## When to Seek Emergency Medical Attention
Look for **emergency warning signs\*** for COVID-19. If someone is showing any of these signs,seek emergency medical care immediately
* Trouble breathing
* Persistent pain or pressure in the chest
* New confusion
* Inability to wake or stay awake
* Blush lips or face

This list is not all possible symptoms. Please call your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.

Call 911 or call ahead to your local emergency facility: Notify the operater that you are seeking care for someone who has or may have COVID-19.

# Testing
## Testing for COVID-19
[Guidence on interpretion COVID-19 Test Results:](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Testing-Guidance.pdf) A guide for interpreting test results and determining what actions to take.

Two kinds of tests are available for COVID-19: [viral tests](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html) and [antibody tests](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/serology-overview.html)
* A viral test tells you if you have a current infection.
* An antibody tests tells you if you had a previous infection.

An antibody test may or may not be able to show if you have a current infection, because it can take 1-3 weeks afer infection to make antibodies. We do not know yet if having antibodies to the virus can protect someone from getting infected with the virus again, or how long that protection might last.
## Who should be tested 
To learn if you have a current infection, viral tests are used. But not everyone needs this test.
* Most people will have mild illness and can recover at home without medical care and may not need to be tested.
* CDC has [guidence](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/clinical-criteria.html) for who should be tested, but decisions about testing are made by [state](https://www.cdc.gov/publichealthgateway/healthdirectories/healthdepartments.html) and [local](https://www.naccho.org/membership/lhd-directory) health departments or healthcare providers.
* If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and want to get tested, call your healthcare provider first.
* You can also visit your state or local health department's website to look for the latest local information on testing.
* Although **supplies of tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find a palce to get tested.**
## Results
* **If you test positive for COVID-19 by a viral test**, know what protective steps to take [if you are sick or caring for someone](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/index.html)
* **If you test negative for COVID-19 by a viral test**, you probably were not infected at the time your sample was collected. However that does not mean you will not get sick. The test result only means that you did not have COVID-19 at the time of testing.

If you test positive ir negative for COVID-19, no matter the type of test, you still should take preventative measure to [protect yourself and others](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html)

## More Information
[HHS Community Based Viral Testing Sites for COVID-19](https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/community-based-testing-sites/index.html)
# Test for Current Infection
Viral tests check samples from your respiratory system (such as swabs of the inside of the nose) to tell you if you currently have an infection with SARA-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Some tests are point-of-care tests, meaning results may be available at the testing site in less than an hour. Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that takes 1-2 days once received by the lab.

If you test positive or negative for COVID-19, no matter the type of test, you still should take preventive measures to [protect yourself and others](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html)
## How to decide if you should get a viral test
Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19. Here is some informations that might help you make decisioms about getting a viral test.
* Most people have mild illness and can recover at home without medical care. They may not nteed to be testes.
* At this time, there is no treatment specifically approved for people who have COVID-19

CDC has [guidence](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/clinical-criteria.html) for who should be tested, but decisions about testing are made by state and local health department or healthcare providers.
## How to get a viral test
COVID-19 testing differs by location. If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and want to get tested, call your healthcare provider first. You can also visit your [state](https://www.cdc.gov/publichealthgateway/healthdirectories/healthdepartments.html) or [local](https://www.naccho.org/membership/lhd-directory) health department’s website to look for the latest local information on testing. Although **supplies of tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find a place to get tested**.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized two viral tests that let you collect either a [nasal swab](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-first-test-patient-home-sample-collection) or a [saliva sample](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-first-diagnostic-test-using-home-collection-saliva) at home. However, you will still need to send your sample to a laboratory for analysis.
## What to do after a viral test
To get your test result, please check with the group that performed your test, such as your healthcare provider or your health department. Check the CDC website to [locate your health department information](https://www.cdc.gov/publichealthgateway/healthdirectories/healthdepartments.html). How long it will take to get your test results back depends on the test used.
* **If you test positive for COVID-19**, know what protective steps to take [If You Are Sick or Caring for Someone](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/index.html).
* **If you test negative for COVID-19**, you probably were not infected at the time your sample was collected. However, that does not mean you will not get sick. It is possible that you were very early in your infection when your sample was collected and that you could test positive later. Or you could be exposed later and then develop illness. In other words, a negative test result does not mean you won’t get sick later. This means you could still spread the virus.

# Test for Past Infection
Antibody blood tests, also called antibody tests, check your blood by looking for antibodies, which show if you had a previous infection with the virus. Depending on when someone was infected and the timing of the test, the test may not find antibodies in someone with a current COVID-19 infection. Antibodies are proteins that help fight off infections. Antibody tests should not be used to diagnose someone as being currently sick with COVID-19. To see if you have a cureent infection, you need a viral test, which checks respiratory samples, such as a swab from inside your nose. 

Antibody tests are available through healthcare providers and laboratories.

If you test positive or negative for COVID-19 on a viral or an antibody test, you still should take preventive measures to [protect yourself and others](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html).

## How to get an antibody test
Check with your healthcare provider to see if they offer antibody tests.

**If you test positive**
* A positive test result shows you have antibodies that likely resulted from an infection with SARS-CoV-2, or possibly a related coronavirus
* It's unclear if those antibodies can provide protection(immunity) against getting infected again. This means that we do not know at this time if antibodies make you immune to the virus.
* If you have no symptoms, you likely do not have an active infections and no additional follow-up is needed.
* If you have [symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html) and meet other [guidelines for testing](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-criteria.html), you would need another type of tests called a nucleic acid test or [viral test](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html). This test uses respiratory samples, such as a swab from inside your nose, to confirm COVID-19.An antibody (blood) test cannot tell if you are currently sick with COVID-19. 
* It's possible you might test positive for antibodies and you might not have or ever has symptoms of COVID-19. This is known as having an asymptomatic infection, or an infection without symptoms.

**If you test negative**
* If you test negative for COVID-19 antibodies, you probably did not have a previous infections that has gotten better. However, you could have a current infection, It's possible you could still get sick if you have been exposed to the virus recently,since antibodies dont show up for 1-3 weeks after infection. This means you could still spread the virus.
* Some people may take even longer to develop antibodies, and some people may not develop antibodies .
* If you have [symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html) and meet other [guidelines for testing](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-criteria.html),you would need another type of test called a nucleic acid or [viral test](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html).This test uses respiratory samples, such as a swab from inside your nose, to confirm COVID-19. An antibody test cannot tell if you are currently sick with COVID-19.

# CDC’s work in antibody testing
CDC is evaluating commercial antibody tests
CDC is evaluating the performance of commercially manufactured antibody tests in collaboration with other government agencies. FDA has authorized emergency use of several antibody tests.

For more information:
* [FDA Emergency Use Authorizations for COVID-19](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/emergency-use-authorizations#covid19ivd)
* [Insight into FDA’s Revised Policy on Antibody Tests: Prioritizing Access and Accuracy](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/fda-voices/insight-fdas-revised-policy-antibody-tests-prioritizing-access-and-accuracy)
* [EUA Authorized Serology Test Performance](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/eua-authorized-serology-test-performance)

CDC is conducting [serologic surveillance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/serology-surveillance/index.html)to estimate the total number of people who have been infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 in the United States. CDC is also using antibody testing to learn more about how the body’s immune system responds to the virus and to explore how the virus spreads among people exposed to it. The information CDC is looking at comes from many groups, including blood donors and household contacts of people who had symptoms and were diagnosed with COVID-19.

CDC is supporting [state, local, tribal and territorial laboratory capacity](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/open-america/laboratory.html)

# How It Spreads
COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly through close contact from person-to-person. Some people without symptoms may be able to spread the virus. We are still learning about how the virus spreads and the severity of illness it causes.
## Person-to-person spread
The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.
* Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).
* Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks.
* These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
* COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms.
## The virus spreads easily between people
How easily a virus spreads from person-to-person can vary. Some viruses are highly contagious, like measles, while other viruses do not spread as easily. Another factor is whether the spread is sustained, which means it goes from person-to-person without stopping.

**The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading very easily and sustainably between people.** Information from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic suggest that this virus is spreading more efficiently than influenza, but not as efficiently as measles, which is highly contagious.

# The virus may be spread in other ways
It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by **touching a surface or object that has the virus on it** and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes. This is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads, but we are still learning more about how this virus spreads.

## Spread between animals and people
* At this time, the risk of COVID-19 spreading from animals to people is considered to be low. Learn about [COVID-19 and pets and other animals.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/animals/pets-other-animals.html)
* It appears that the virus that causes COVID-19 can spread **from people to animals** in some situations. CDC is aware of a small number of pets worldwide, including cats and dogs, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19. Learn what you should do [if you have pets.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/pets.html)
## Protect yourself and others
**The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus.** You can take steps to slow the spread.
* [Maintain good social distance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html) (about 6 feet). This is very important in preventing the spread of COVID-19.
* [Wash your hands](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html) often with soap and water. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
* [Routinely clean and disinfect](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/disinfecting-your-home.html)frequently touched surfaces.

* **The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus.**
* The virus is thought to [spread mainly from person-to-person.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html)
   * Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet)
   * Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks.
   * These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
   * Some recent studies have suggested that COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms.
## Everyone Should
**Wash your hands often**
* [Wash your hands](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html) often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
* If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.
* Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.

**Avoid close contact**

* **Avoid close contact with people who are sick, even inside your home.** If possible, maintain 6 feet between the person who is sick and other household members.
* **Put distance between yourself and other people outside of your home.**
   * Remember that some people without symptoms may be able to spread virus.
   * [Stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arms’ length) from other people.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html)
   * Do not gather in groups.
   * Stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings.
   * Keeping distance from others is especially important for [people who are at higher risk of getting very sick.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html)

**Cover your mouth and nose with a cloth face cover when around others**
* You could spread COVID-19 to others even if you do not feel sick.
* Everyone should wear a [cloth face cover](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html) when they have to go out in public, for example to the grocery store or to pick up other necessities.
   * Cloth face coverings should not be placed on young children under age 2,  anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.
* The cloth face cover is meant to protect other people in case you are infected.
* Do NOT use a facemask meant for a healthcare worker.
* Continue to keep about 6 feet between yourself and others. The cloth face 
cover is not a substitute for social distancing.

**Cover coughs and sneezes**
* **If you are in a private setting and do not have on your cloth face covering, remember to always cover your mouth and nose** with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow.
* **Throw used tissues** in the trash.
* Immediately **wash your hands** with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, clean your hands with a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.

**Clean and disinfect**
* **Clean AND disinfect [frequently touched surfaces](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/disinfecting-your-home.html) daily.** This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.
* **If surfaces are dirty, clean them.** Use detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.
* **Then, use a household disinfectant.** Most common [EPA-registered household disinfectant](https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2-covid-19)will work.

**Monitor Your Health**
* **Be alert for symptoms.** Watch for fever, cough, shortness of breath, or [other symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html) of COVID-19.
  * Especially important if you are [running essential errands,](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/essential-goods-services.html) going into the office or workplace, and in settings where it may be difficult to keep a [physical distance of 6 feet.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html)
* **Take your temperature** if symptoms develop.
  * Don’t take your temperature within 30 minutes of exercising or after taking medications that could lower your temperature, like acetaminophen.
* Follow [CDC guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html) if symptoms develop.

# **Social Distancing**
Keep Your Distance to Slow the Spread

Limiting face-to-face contact with others is the best way to reduce the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

**What is social distancing?**

![What is social distancing](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/images/COVIDweb_avoidCloseContact_masks_rect-01.png)


Social distancing, also called “physical distancing,” means keeping space between yourself and other people outside of your home. To practice social or physical distancing:

* Stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arms’ length) from other people
* Do not gather in groups
* Stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings

In addition to [everyday steps to prevent COVID-19,](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html) keeping space between you and others is one of the best tools we have to avoid being exposed to this virus and slowing its spread locally and across the country and world.

Limit close contact with others outside your household in indoor and outdoor spaces. Since people can spread the virus before they know they are sick, it is important to stay away from others when possible, even if you—or they—have no symptoms. Social distancing is especially important for [people who are at higher risk](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html)for severe illness from COVID-19.

Many people have personal circumstances or situations that present challenges with practicing social distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19.  Please see the following guidance for additional recommendations and considerations for:

* [Households Living in Close Quarters: How to Protect Those Who Are Most Vulnerable](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/living-in-close-quarters.html)
* [Living in Shared Housing](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/shared-housing/index.html)

* [People Experiencing Homelessness](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/homelessness.html)

**If you have been exposed or are sick**
* [Separate from others to limit the spread of COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/quarantine-isolation.html)
* [Take care of yourself while you’re sick](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html)

## Why practice social distancing?
COVID-19 spreads mainly among people who are in close contact (within about 6 feet) for a prolonged period. Spread happens when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, and droplets from their mouth or nose are launched into the air and land in the mouths or noses of people nearby. The droplets can also be inhaled into the lungs. Recent studies indicate that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role in the spread of COVID-19.

It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or eyes. However, this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. COVID-19 can live for hours or days on a surface, depending on factors such as sunlight, humidity, and the type of surface. Social distancing helps limit opportunities to come in contact with contaminated surfaces and infected people outside the home.

Although the risk of severe illness may be different for everyone, anyone can get and spread COVID-19. Everyone has a role to play in slowing the spread and protecting themselves, their family, and their community.

## Tips for social distancing
* Follow guidance from authorities where you live.
* If you need to shop for food or medicine at the grocery store or pharmacy, stay at least 6 feet away from others. Also consider other options:
  * Use mail-order for medications, if possible.
  * Consider a grocery delivery service.
* Cover your mouth and nose with a [cloth face covering](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html) when around others, including when you have to go out in public, for example to the grocery store.
  * Cloth face coverings should NOT be placed on children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.
  * Keep at least 6 feet between yourself and others, even when you wear a face covering.
* Avoid gatherings of any size outside your household, such as a friend’s house, parks, restaurants, shops, or any other place. This advice applies to people of any age, including teens and younger adults. Children should not have in-person playdates while school is out. To help maintain social connections while social distancing, [learn tips to keep children healthy while school’s out.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/children.html)
* Work from home when possible. See additional information for [critical infrastructure workforce](https://www.cisa.gov/critical-infrastructure-sectors)from Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).
* Limit using any kind of public transportation, ridesharing, or taxis, if possible. If you must use public transportation, [follow these tips to protect yourself.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/using-transportation.html)
* If you are a student or parent, talk to your school about options for digital/distance learning.

**Stay connected while staying away.** It is very important to stay in touch with friends and family that don’t live in your home. Call, video chat, or stay connected using social media. Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations and having to socially distance yourself from someone you love can be difficult.
