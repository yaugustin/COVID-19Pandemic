# Coronavirus Disease 2019
## Symptoms of Coronavirus
## What you need to know
* Anyone can have mild to severe symptoms
* Older adults and people who have severe underlying medical conditions like heart or lung diseases seem to be at higher risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 illness.
## Watch for symptoms
People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported - ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness
Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. People with these symptoms may have COVID-19.
* Cough
* Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing 
* Fever
* Chills
* Muscle Pain
* Sore throat
* New loss of taste or smell

This list is not all posssible symptoms. Other less commom symptoms have been reported , including gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
## When to Seek Emergency Medical Attention
Look for **emergency warning signs\*** for COVID-19. If someone is showing any of these signs,seek emergency medical care immediately
* Trouble breathing
* Persistent pain or pressure in the chest
* New confusion
* Inability to wake or stay awake
* Blush lips or face

This list is not all possible symptoms. Please call your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.

Call 911 or call ahead to your local emergency facility: Notify the operater that you are seeking care for someone who has or may have COVID-19.

# Testing
## Testing for COVID-19
[Guidence on interpretion COVID-19 Test Results:](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Testing-Guidance.pdf) A guide for interpreting test results and determining what actions to take.

Two kinds of tests are available for COVID-19: [viral tests](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html) and [antibody tests](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/serology-overview.html)
* A viral test tells you if you have a current infection.
* An antibody tests tells you if you had a previous infection.

An antibody test may or may not be able to show if you have a current infection, because it can take 1-3 weeks afer infection to make antibodies. We do not know yet if having antibodies to the virus can protect someone from getting infected with the virus again, or how long that protection might last.
## Who should be tested 
To learn if you have a current infection, viral tests are used. But not everyone needs this test.
* Most people will have mild illness and can recover at home without medical care and may not need to be tested.
* CDC has [guidence](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/clinical-criteria.html) for who should be tested, but decisions about testing are made by [state](https://www.cdc.gov/publichealthgateway/healthdirectories/healthdepartments.html) and [local](https://www.naccho.org/membership/lhd-directory) health departments or healthcare providers.
* If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and want to get tested, call your healthcare provider first.
* You can also visit your state or local health department's website to look for the latest local information on testing.
* Although **supplies of tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find a palce to get tested.**
## Results
* **If you test positive for COVID-19 by a viral test**, know what protective steps to take [if you are sick or caring for someone](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/index.html)
* **If you test negative for COVID-19 by a viral test**, you probably were not infected at the time your sample was collected. However that does not mean you will not get sick. The test result only means that you did not have COVID-19 at the time of testing.

If you test positive ir negative for COVID-19, no matter the type of test, you still should take preventative measure to [protect yourself and others](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html)

# Test for Current Infection
Viral tests check samples from your respiratory system (such as swabs of the inside of the nose) to tell you if you currently have an infection with SARA-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Some tests are point-of-care tests, meaning results may be available at the testing site in less than an hour. Other tests must be sent to a laboratory to analyze, a process that takes 1-2 days once received by the lab.

If you test positive or negative for COVID-19, no matter the type of test, you still should take preventive measures to [protect yourself and others](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html)
## How to decide if you should get a viral test
Not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19. Here is some informations that might help you make decisioms about getting a viral test.
* Most people have mild illness and can recover at home without medical care. They may not nteed to be testes.
* At this time, there is no treatment specifically approved for people who have COVID-19

CDC has [guidence](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/hcp/clinical-criteria.html) for who should be tested, but decisions about testing are made by state and local health department or healthcare providers.
## How to get a viral test
COVID-19 testing differs by location. If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and want to get tested, call your healthcare provider first. You can also visit your [state](https://www.cdc.gov/publichealthgateway/healthdirectories/healthdepartments.html) or [local](https://www.naccho.org/membership/lhd-directory) health department’s website to look for the latest local information on testing. Although **supplies of tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find a place to get tested**.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized two viral tests that let you collect either a [nasal swab](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-first-test-patient-home-sample-collection) or a [saliva sample](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-first-diagnostic-test-using-home-collection-saliva) at home. However, you will still need to send your sample to a laboratory for analysis.
## What to do after a viral test
To get your test result, please check with the group that performed your test, such as your healthcare provider or your health department. Check the CDC website to [locate your health department information](https://www.cdc.gov/publichealthgateway/healthdirectories/healthdepartments.html). How long it will take to get your test results back depends on the test used.
* **If you test positive for COVID-19**, know what protective steps to take [If You Are Sick or Caring for Someone](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/index.html).
* **If you test negative for COVID-19**, you probably were not infected at the time your sample was collected. However, that does not mean you will not get sick. It is possible that you were very early in your infection when your sample was collected and that you could test positive later. Or you could be exposed later and then develop illness. In other words, a negative test result does not mean you won’t get sick later. This means you could still spread the virus.

# Test for Past Infection
Antibody blood tests, also called antibody tests, check your blood by looking for antibodies, which show if you had a previous infection with the virus. Depending on when someone was infected and the timing of the test, the test may not find antibodies in someone with a current COVID-19 infection. Antibodies are proteins that help fight off infections. Antibody tests should not be used to diagnose someone as being currently sick with COVID-19. To see if you have a cureent infection, you need a viral test, which checks respiratory samples, such as a swab from inside your nose. 

Antibody tests are available through healthcare providers and laboratories.

If you test positive or negative for COVID-19 on a viral or an antibody test, you still should take preventive measures to [protect yourself and others](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html).

## How to get an antibody test
Check with your healthcare provider to see if they offer antibody tests.

**If you test positive**
* A positive test result shows you have antibodies that likely resulted from an infection with SARS-CoV-2, or possibly a related coronavirus
* It's unclear if those antibodies can provide protection(immunity) against getting infected again. This means that we do not know at this time if antibodies make you immune to the virus.
* If you have no symptoms, you likely do not have an active infections and no additional follow-up is needed.
* If you have [symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html) and meet other [guidelines for testing](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-criteria.html), you would need another type of tests called a nucleic acid test or [viral test](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html). This test uses respiratory samples, such as a swab from inside your nose, to confirm COVID-19.An antibody (blood) test cannot tell if you are currently sick with COVID-19. 
* It's possible you might test positive for antibodies and you might not have or ever has symptoms of COVID-19. This is known as having an asymptomatic infection, or an infection without symptoms.

**If you test negative**
* If you test negative for COVID-19 antibodies, you probably did not have a previous infections that has gotten better. However, you could have a current infection, It's possible you could still get sick if you have been exposed to the virus recently,since antibodies dont show up for 1-3 weeks after infection. This means you could still spread the virus.
* Some people may take even longer to develop antibodies, and some people may not develop antibodies .
* If you have [symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html) and meet other [guidelines for testing](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-criteria.html),you would need another type of test called a nucleic acid or [viral test](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html).This test uses respiratory samples, such as a swab from inside your nose, to confirm COVID-19. An antibody test cannot tell if you are currently sick with COVID-19.

# CDC’s work in antibody testing
CDC is evaluating commercial antibody tests
CDC is evaluating the performance of commercially manufactured antibody tests in collaboration with other government agencies. FDA has authorized emergency use of several antibody tests.

* [Insight into FDA’s Revised Policy on Antibody Tests: Prioritizing Access and Accuracy](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/fda-voices/insight-fdas-revised-policy-antibody-tests-prioritizing-access-and-accuracy)
* [EUA Authorized Serology Test Performance](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/eua-authorized-serology-test-performance)

CDC is conducting [serologic surveillance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/serology-surveillance/index.html)to estimate the total number of people who have been infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 in the United States. CDC is also using antibody testing to learn more about how the body’s immune system responds to the virus and to explore how the virus spreads among people exposed to it. The information CDC is looking at comes from many groups, including blood donors and household contacts of people who had symptoms and were diagnosed with COVID-19.

CDC is supporting [state, local, tribal and territorial laboratory capacity](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/open-america/laboratory.html)
